# hello-world
Hi humanity!
Currently you don't know me and, obviosly, haven't heard about me at all, but I'm certainly sure you'll recognize me as a worldwide software developer at an early date! Or at not such an early one, it can drag on couple of months... or years. But that's not the point,
the fact is I've just started my IT career by writing this strings and ther're any obstacles in righting me off from the path to success!
I'm ready to get the ball rowling!
